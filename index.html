    <h1>Maybe the Greatest Anime of all time</h1>

    <p>I also happen to be a huge anime fan, so i decided to write about what i think is the <strong>greatest anime of all time</strong>. Which happens to be  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a>.
      This anime is a story or two brothers, who lose parts of their body while trying to revive their dead mother, with the use of alchemy. What i really like about this anime is that it has a little bit of everything
      and all the characters have their own development so you can relate to their mothivations a lot better. While i am not doing this anime justice with this summary, this is the highest rated anime ever.
